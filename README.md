This is the <del>Rhythyms</del> Chord Qualities mod GitHub page. Feel free to poke around the files to see how it works.

You can find the most updated html manual here, as well as the most recent build (to stick in the mods folder).

This is updated more frequently than the steam workshop version, so it may be less stable as a result.
